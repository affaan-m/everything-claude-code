## Cross-Platform Distribution Strategy

### Content Cascade Model

Write content in order of depth, then adapt downward:

```
Zhihu (deepest analysis, 2000-6000 chars)
  -> WeChat (polished article, 1500-4000 chars)
    -> Xiaohongshu (key takeaways, 300-1000 chars)
    -> Twitter (English thread, 5-15 tweets)
```

### Adaptation Rules

| From | To | Strategy |
|------|----|----------|
| Zhihu | WeChat | Restructure for narrative flow, add visual breaks, trim academic tone |
| Zhihu | Xiaohongshu | Extract 3-5 actionable tips, rewrite casually, add formatting |
| Zhihu/WeChat | Twitter | Translate to English, extract key insights, one per tweet |
| Twitter | Zhihu | Expand thread into full analysis with sources |

### Language Handling

- Chinese platforms (WeChat, Zhihu, Xiaohongshu): Write natively in Chinese
- English platforms (Twitter/X): Write natively in English
- Cross-language adaptation is NOT direct translation; rewrite for the target audience

## Content Quality Principles

1. **Value First**: Every piece must teach, inform, or inspire
2. **One Core Idea**: Each content piece centers on a single thesis
3. **Evidence-Based**: Support claims with data, examples, or experience
4. **Platform-Native**: Write for each platform's culture, not just format
5. **Authentic Voice**: Maintain a consistent personal perspective
6. **Actionable**: Readers should know what to do after reading
