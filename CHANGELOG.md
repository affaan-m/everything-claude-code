# Changelog

## Unreleased

### BREAKING

- `continuous-learning-v2`: observer data directory moved from `~/.claude/homunculus/` to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/ecc-homunculus/`. Set `CLV2_HOMUNCULUS_DIR` to override. Run `skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/migrate-homunculus.sh` once to move existing data. Required because Claude Code's `--print`-mode sensitive-path guard on `~/.claude/**` blocks instinct writes from the Haiku observer subprocess.

## 1.10.0 - 2026-04-05

### Highlights

- Public release surface synced to the live repo after multiple weeks of OSS growth and backlog merges.
- Operator workflow lane expanded with voice, graph-ranking, billing, workspace, and outbound skills.
- Media generation lane expanded with Manim and Remotion-first launch tooling.
- ECC 2.0 alpha control-plane binary now builds locally from `ecc2/` and exposes the first usable CLI/TUI surface.

### Release Surface

- Updated plugin, marketplace, Codex, OpenCode, and agent metadata to `1.10.0`.
- Synced published counts to the live OSS surface: 38 agents, 156 skills, 72 commands.
- Refreshed top-level install-facing docs and marketplace descriptions to match current repo state.

### New Workflow Lanes

- `brand-voice` — canonical source-derived writing-style system.
- `social-graph-ranker` — weighted warm-intro graph ranking primitive.
- `connections-optimizer` — network pruning/addition workflow on top of graph ranking.
- `customer-billing-ops`, `google-workspace-ops`, `project-flow-ops`, `workspace-surface-audit`.
- `manim-video`, `remotion-video-creation`, `nestjs-patterns`.

### ECC 2.0 Alpha

- `cargo build --manifest-path ecc2/Cargo.toml` passes on the repository baseline.
- `ecc-tui` currently exposes `dashboard`, `start`, `sessions`, `status`, `stop`, `resume`, and `daemon`.
- The alpha is real and usable for local experimentation, but the broader control-plane roadmap remains incomplete and should not be treated as GA.

### Notes

- The Claude plugin remains limited by platform-level rules distribution constraints; the selective install / OSS path is still the most reliable full install.
- This release is a repo-surface correction and ecosystem sync, not a claim that the full ECC 2.0 roadmap is complete.

## 1.9.0 - 2026-03-20

### Highlights

- Selective install architecture with manifest-driven pipeline and SQLite state store.
- Language coverage expanded to 10+ ecosystems with 6 new agents and language-specific rules.
- Observer reliability hardened with memory throttling, sandbox fixes, and 5-layer loop guard.
- Self-improving skills foundation with skill evolution and session adapters.

## 1.8.0 - 2026-03-04

### Highlights

- Harness-first release focused on reliability, eval discipline, and autonomous loop operations.
- Hook runtime now supports profile-based control and targeted hook disabling.
- NanoClaw v2 adds model routing, skill hot-load, branching, search, compaction, export, and metrics.

### Core

- Added new commands: `/harness-audit`, `/loop-start`, `/loop-status`, `/quality-gate`, `/model-route`.
- Added new skills:
  - `agent-harness-construction`
  - `agentic-engineering`
  - `ralphinho-rfc-pipeline`
  - `ai-first-engineering`
  - `enterprise-agent-ops`
  - `nanoclaw-repl`
  - `continuous-agent-loop`
- Added new agents:
  - `harness-optimizer`
  - `loop-operator`

### Hook Reliability

- Fixed SessionStart root resolution with robust fallback search.
- Moved session summary persistence to `Stop` where transcript payload is available.
- Added quality-gate and cost-tracker hooks.
- Replaced fragile inline hook one-liners with dedicated script files.
- Added `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE` and `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS` controls.

### Cross-Platform

- Improved Windows-safe path handling in doc warning logic.
- Hardened observer loop behavior to avoid non-interactive hangs.

### Notes

- `autonomous-loops` is kept as a compatibility alias for one release; `continuous-agent-loop` is the canonical name.
