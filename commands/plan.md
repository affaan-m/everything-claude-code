Create an implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Analyze requirements and identify success criteria
2. Review existing codebase for affected components
3. Break down into phases with specific steps and file paths
4. Identify dependencies and risks (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. **WAIT for user confirmation before coding**

Output format:
```
# Plan: [Feature Name]

## Phases
1. [Phase]: [Details]
2. [Phase]: [Details]

## Risks
- HIGH: [Risk]
- MEDIUM: [Risk]

**WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION**: Proceed? (yes/no/modify)
```

User responses:
- "yes" / "proceed" - Start implementation
- "modify: [changes]" - Revise plan
