# Testing Standards

## Test-Driven Development

FOR NEW FUNCTIONALITY: Always write tests before implementation.

TDD Cycle:
1. Write a failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

## Test Quality

- Tests are first-class code — no lower quality standards
- Never skip tests to save time — they ARE the development
- Make tests readable: name them like documentation
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests for business logic

## Coverage Requirements

- All public APIs: 100% coverage
- Business logic: 90%+ coverage
- Edge cases and error paths must be tested
- Happy path is the minimum — test unhappy paths too

## Test Structure

```
Describe: <feature or class>
  Context: <condition/scenario>
    It: <expected behavior>
      Arrange: setup test data
      Act: perform the action
      Assert: verify the result
```

## What to Test

- Error conditions and edge cases
- Boundary values
- Integration points
- Async operations and timing
- State transitions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test names describe behavior, not implementation
- [ ] No test duplication
- [ ] Mocks are minimal and necessary
- [ ] Tests are independent (no shared state)
- [ ] CI passes before merging
